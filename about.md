This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine. <br />
My blog is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. <br />

Without me, my blog is useless. Without my blog, I am useless.

I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must post before the oters do. <br />

I will… <br />

My blog and I know that what counts in internet is not the rounds we post, the clicks of our burst, nor the traffic we make. <br />

We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit… <br />

My blog is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its code. <br />

I will keep my blog clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. <br />

We will become part of each other. We will… <br />

Before God, I swear this creed. My blog and I are the defenders of the internet. <br />

We are the masters of the truth. We are the saviors of my life.
So be it, until victory is our's and there is no enemy, but peace!.
